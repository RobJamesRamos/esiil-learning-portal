# Audience

## Does this module require a new textbook?
If not, where should it be placed in an existing textbook? See the [current list of textbooks](https://cu-esiil-edu.github.io/esiil-learning-portal/)

## Are there any pre-requisites for students? What level of student is this module geared towards?

Introductory/Beginner learners can:
1) open and run an interactive notebook or script
2) import libraries/packages
3) store values in variables
4) perform mathematical calculations
5) run some built-in functions

Intermediate learners can:
1) use code to work with tabular (.csv), geometric (.shp, .gpkg), and raster (.tif, .nc, etc.) data
2) create maps and plots using code
3) group, aggregate, and summarize data

Advanced learners can:
1) run computations repeatedly using loops or vectorized functions
2) use conditionals (if/then) to control program flow, cache data and computations, and/or run tests and checks
3) use APIs to access data
4) write their own functions

Expert learners can:
1) Efficiently utilize high-performance computing
2) Write and test commercial software and/or apps
3) Optimize code
