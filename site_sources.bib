	abstract = {As the ecological and environmental sciences become more data intensive, there are growing demands for training designed to help early-career scientists level-up their technical data and analytics skills. The paths to acquiring the interdisciplinary sets of skills required to work with increasingly large and complex environmental data are frequently filled with a variety of obstacles, particularly for members from historically marginalized groups. We present models for Environmental Data Science (EDS) education that help meet the need for data-intensive training for life, earth, and environmental scientists from a diversity of backgrounds and career stages, including skills related to remote sensing, coding, and programming. Led by researchers at Earth Lab and the NSF-funded Environmental Data Science Innovation \& Inclusion Lab (ESIIL), at the University of Colorado Boulder, this study will present findings from surveys of students enrolled in the Earth Data Analytics Professional Graduate Certificate Program (EDA), and the NSF-funded Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC). Over five years, these two programs have helped a diverse cohort of professionals (n = 96) gain fundamental EDS skills for career advancement, and built capacity to teach and learn EDS at other institutions catering to minority communities, including Tribal Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions. Students enrolled in these programs learn how to find and work with data to answer questions in the context of applied ecological and environmental science using the Python programming language. Students then apply their new skills by designing and completing culturally-relevant projects that have focused on topics including characterizing vegetation using NEON remote sensing data, emerald ash borer detections in Minnesota cities, bird behaviors within the Prairie Pothole Region, and more. All lessons are taught using a free and open curriculum, which provides widely accessible teaching and learning materials (earthdatascience.org). Using Likert surveys and a Rasch modeling approach, we demonstrate that students from these programs show significant growth in their self-reported comfort and confidence with different data science skills (p {\textless} 0.001), as well as a deeper understanding of core disciplinary ecological and environmental science concepts. In the coming months, we will launch the ESIIL Stars internship and ESIIL Data Short Course, modeled after Earth Lab’s EDSC and EDA programs. Inclusive programs such as these are integral to innovation in data-intensive education and empowering the next generation of diverse ecological and environmental data scientists.},

These skills are imperative to harness information contained in a growing volume of complex data to solve the world's most pressing environmental challenges. Despite the importance of these skills, Earth and Environmental Data Science (EDS) training is not equally accessible, contributing to a lack of diversity in the field. This creates a critical need for EDS training opportunities designed specifically for underrepresented groups. In response, we designed the Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC) which couples a paid internship for undergraduate students with faculty training to build capacity to teach and learn EDS using Python at smaller Minority Serving Institutions. EDSC participants are further empowered to teach these skills at their home institutions which scales the program beyond the training lead by our team. Using a Rasch modeling approach, we found that participating in the EDSC program had a significant impact on learners’ comfort and confidence with technical and non-technical data science skills, as well as their science identity and sense of belonging in science, two critical aspects of recruiting and retaining members of underrepresented groups in STEM.},

	abstract = {Detecting effective parameters in flood occurrence is one of the most important issues that has drawn more attention in recent years. Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) are two efficient ways to spatially predict Flood Risk Mapping (FRM). In this study, a web-based platform called the Google Earth Engine (GEE) (Google Company, Mountain View, CA, USA) was used to obtain flood risk indices for the Galikesh River basin, Northern Iran. With the aid of Landsat 8 satellite imagery and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), 11 risk indices (Elevation (El), Slope (Sl), Slope Aspect (SA), Land Use (LU), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), River Distance (RD), Waterway and River Density (WRD), Soil Texture (ST]), and Maximum One-Day Precipitation (M1DP)) were provided. In the next step, all of these indices were imported into ArcMap 10.8 (Esri, West Redlands, CA, USA) software for index normalization and to better visualize the graphical output. Afterward, an intelligent learning machine (Random Forest (RF)), which is a robust data mining technique, was used to compute the importance degree of each index and to obtain the flood hazard map. According to the results, the indices of WRD, RD, M1DP, and El accounted for about 68.27 percent of the total flood risk. Among these indices, the WRD index containing about 23.8 percent of the total risk has the greatest impact on floods. According to FRM mapping, about 21 and 18 percent of the total areas stood at the higher and highest risk areas, respectively.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of climate and land use changes on flood susceptibility areas in the Tajan watershed, Iran. To do this, land use changes over the next 20 years (2019–2040) were predicted from land use changes of the past 29 years (1990–2019) using the land change modeler (LCM) method. Future climate change was projected for the next 20 years (2020–2040) based on climate data from 1990 to 2015 using Lars-WG software and two scenarios, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5. Twelve factors that influence flooding and 262 locations of past floods were used to model the spatial pattern of flood susceptibility in the watershed. A random forest (RF) model and a Bayesian generalized linear model (GLMbayes) were used to predict areas susceptible to flooding. The results showed that elevation (21.55), distance from river (15.28), land use (11.1), slope (10.58), and rainfall (6.8) are the most important factors affecting flooding in this basin. The factors were modified according to land use changes and climate changes and the models were revised. The land use and climate forecasting in this region indicate that land use change, like decreased forest cover (−77.19 km2) and reduced rangeland (−218.83 km2) near rivers and downstream, can be expected and rainfall is projected to increase (under from both scenarios). These changes would result in increased probabilities of flooding in the downstream portion of the watershed and near the sea. The area-under-the-curve evaluation of the models indicates that the RF model more accurately predicted flood probability (0.91) than did the GLMbayes model (0.847).},

	abstract = {In this paper, an ensemble method, which demonstrated efficiency in GIS based flood modeling, was used to create flood probability indices for the Damansara River catchment in Malaysia. To estimate flood probability, the frequency ratio (FR) approach was combined with support vector machine (SVM) using a radial basis function kernel. Thirteen flood conditioning parameters, namely, altitude, aspect, slope, curvature, stream power index, topographic wetness index, sediment transport index, topographic roughness index, distance from river, geology, soil, surface runoff, and land use/cover (LULC), were selected. Each class of conditioning factor was weighted using the FR approach and entered as input for SVM modeling to optimize all the parameters. The flood hazard map was produced by combining the flood probability map with flood-triggering factors such as; averaged daily rainfall and flood inundation depth. Subsequently, the hydraulic 2D high-resolution sub-grid model (HRS) was applied to estimate the flood inundation depth. Furthermore, vulnerability weights were assigned to each element at risk based on their importance. Finally flood risk map was generated. The results of this research demonstrated that the proposed approach would be effective for flood risk management in the study area along the expressway and could be easily replicated in other areas.},

Although, SWOT’s data latency and huge data size of rawest point cloud data make it impracticable for real or near-real-time flood forecasting but the SWOT data will provide new insight in the first-hand information of flood mapping. In this study, we explore the potential of SWOT mission for flood mapping over India. It is observed that the spatio-temporal resolution of SWOT allows the observation of 0.67\%, 15.79\%, 29.24\%, 45.54\%, and 8.06\% of Indian districts with one, two, three, four and more than four observations per cycle of SWOT respectively. It is observed that SWOT would have observed 49.6\% of flood events at least once if the mission were launched earlier. The SWOT could also observe 30.6\% of small flood events with flood duration {\textless}4 at least once. Using the information, this study proposes a flood severity map by combining geomorphological and physical flood parameters for a reach of Brahmaputra river. From the map different flood severity zones can be observed.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing is a powerful tool to map flooded areas. In recent years, the availability of free satellite data significantly increased in terms of type and frequency, allowing the production of flood maps at low cost around the world. In this work, we propose a semi-automatic method for flood mapping, based only on free satellite images and open-source software. The proposed methods are suitable to be applied by the community involved in flood hazard management, not necessarily experts in remote sensing processing. As case studies, we selected three flood events that recently occurred in Spain and Italy. Multispectral satellite data acquired by MODIS, Proba-V, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected by Sentinel-1 were used to detect flooded areas using different methodologies (e.g., Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, SAR backscattering variation, and supervised classification). Then, we improved and manually refined the automatic mapping using free ancillary data such as the digital elevation model-based water depth model and available ground truth data. We calculated flood detection performance (flood ratio) for the different datasets by comparing with flood maps made by official river authorities. The results show that it is necessary to consider different factors when selecting the best satellite data. Among these factors, the time of the satellite pass with respect to the flood peak is the most important. With co-flood multispectral images, more than 90\% of the flooded area was detected in the 2015 Ebro flood (Spain) case study. With post-flood multispectral data, the flood ratio showed values under 50\% a few weeks after the 2016 flood in Po and Tanaro plains (Italy), but it remained useful to map the inundated pattern. The SAR could detect flooding only at the co-flood stage, and the flood ratio showed values below 5\% only a few days after the 2016 Po River inundation. Another result of the research was the creation of geomorphology-based inundation maps that matched up to 95\% with official flood maps.},

	abstract = {Sustainable water management is one of the important priorities set out in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations, which calls for efficient use of natural resources. Efficient water management nowadays depends a lot upon simulation models. However, the availability of limited hydro-meteorological data together with limited data sharing practices prohibits simulation modelling and consequently efficient flood risk management of sparsely gauged basins. Advances in remote sensing has significantly contributed to carrying out hydrological studies in ungauged or sparsely gauged basins. In particular, the global datasets of remote sensing observations (e.g., rainfall, evaporation, temperature, land use, terrain, etc.) allow to develop hydrological and hydraulic models of sparsely gauged catchments. In this research, we have considered large scale hydrological and hydraulic modelling, using freely available global datasets, of the sparsely gauged trans-boundary Brahmaputra basin, which has an enormous potential in terms of agriculture, hydropower, water supplies and other utilities. A semi-distributed conceptual hydrological model was developed using HEC-HMS (Hydrologic Modelling System from Hydrologic Engineering Centre). Rainfall estimates from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) was compared with limited gauge data and used in the simulation. The Nash Sutcliffe coefficient of the model with the uncorrected rainfall data in calibration and validation were 0.75 and 0.61 respectively whereas the similar values with the corrected rainfall data were 0.81 and 0.74. The output of the hydrological model was used as a boundary condition and lateral inflow to the hydraulic model. Modelling results obtained using uncorrected and corrected remotely sensed products of rainfall were compared with the discharge values at the basin outlet (Bahadurabad) and with altimetry data from Jason-2 satellite. The simulated flood inundation maps of the lower part of the Brahmaputra basin showed reasonably good match in terms of the probability of detection, success ratio and critical success index. Overall, this study demonstrated that reliable and robust results can be obtained in both hydrological and hydraulic modelling using remote sensing data as the only input to large scale and sparsely gauged basins.},

	abstract = {The unprecedented availability of 6-hourly data from a multi-model GCM ensemble in the CMIP5 data archive presents the new opportunity to dynamically downscale multiple GCMs to develop high-resolution climate projections relevant to detailed assessment of climate vulnerability and climate change impacts. This enables the development of high resolution projections derived from the same set of models that are used to characterise the range of future climate changes at the global and large-scale, and as assessed in the IPCC AR5. However, the technical and human resource required to dynamically-downscale the full CMIP5 ensemble are significant and not necessary if the aim is to develop scenarios covering a representative range of future climate conditions relevant to a climate change risk assessment. This paper illustrates a methodology for selecting from the available CMIP5 models in order to identify a set of 8–10 GCMs for use in regional climate change assessments. The selection focuses on their suitability across multiple regions—Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa. The selection (a) avoids the inclusion of the least realistic models for each region and (b) simultaneously captures the maximum possible range of changes in surface temperature and precipitation for three continental-scale regions. We find that, of the CMIP5 GCMs with 6-hourly fields available, three simulate the key regional aspects of climate sufficiently poorly that we consider the projections from those models ‘implausible’ (MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and IPSL-CM5B-LR). From the remaining models, we demonstrate a selection methodology which avoids the poorest models by including them in the set only if their exclusion would significantly reduce the range of projections sampled. The result of this process is a set of models suitable for using to generate downscaled climate change information for a consistent multi-regional assessment of climate change impacts and adaptation.},

	abstract = {Global climate changes are becoming main threats to hydrological cycle, which thus influence environmental, social, and economic systems. Climate change studies using global climate models (GCMs) are mostly used for mitigation and adaptation strategies regarding the changing climate. The current GCMs’ data are, however, too coarse to use directly at the regional and local scales for climate change studies. Two widely used statistical downscaling methods, namely LARS-WG and SDSM models, were used to study the current and future climate change of Tana Basin, Ethiopia. Four GCMs (GFCM21, HadCM3, MPEH5, and NCCCS) for LARS-WG and two GCMs (HadCM3 and CanESM2) for SDSM with different emission scenarios were evaluated. Overall results indicated an acceptable response of the models to simulate and forecast climatic variables under HadCM3 and CanESM2 GCMs. Rainfall results downscaled by LARS-WG from the four GCMs indicated high intermodal variabilities and non-consistence; Increasing trend of rainfall showed on three of the GCMs while one GCM showed a decreasing trend in the range of − 9.6\% to 45.2\%. The four GCMs rainfall average ensemble value showed an increasing trend ranging from 3.9\% to 18.8\%, which is also consistent with HadCM3 projections ranging from 4.1\% to 19.2\%. However, the downscaled results from all four models showed increasing maximum and minimum temperature for all time periods. The mean annual maximum and minimum temperature change increased from 0.9 °C to 2.9 °C and 0.6 °C to 2.5 °C, respectively, while annual mean relative change of rainfall ranged from 9.9\% to 44.7\%. Both SDSM and LARS-WG methods were obtained good monthly rainfall data series than daily rainfall data series in the study area. However, both models with the selected GCMs (HadCM3 and CanESM2) performed reasonably well to simulate temperature than rainfall.},

	abstract = {This study assesses the performance of 22 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) historical simulations of rainfall over East Africa (EA) against reanalyzed datasets during 1951–2005. The datasets were sourced from Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) and Climate Research Unit (CRU). The metrics used to rank CMIP5 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) based on their performance in reproducing the observed rainfall include correlation coefficient, standard deviation, bias, percentage bias, root mean square error, and trend. Performances of individual models vary widely. The overall performance of the models over EA is generally low. The models reproduce the observed bimodal rainfall over EA. However, majority of them overestimate and underestimate the October–December (OND) and March–May (MAM) rainfall, respectively. The monthly (inter-annual) correlation between model and reanalyzed is high (low). More than a third of the models show a positive bias of the annual rainfall. High standard deviation in rainfall is recorded in the Lake Victoria Basin, central Kenya, and eastern Tanzania. A number of models reproduce the spatial standard deviation of rainfall during MAM season as compared to OND. The top eight models that produce rainfall over EA relatively well are as follows: CanESM2, CESM1-CAM5, CMCC-CESM, CNRM-CM5, CSIRO-Mk3-6-0, EC-EARTH, INMCM4, and MICROC5. Although these results form a fairly good basis for selection of GCMs for carrying out climate projections and downscaling over EA, it is evident that there is still need for critical improvement in rainfall-related processes in the models assessed. Therefore, climate users are advised to use the projections of rainfall from CMIP5 models over EA cautiously when making decisions on adaptation to or mitigation of climate change.},

The Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC) is a fully-online model that builds capacity for faculty and undergraduate students at institutions serving underrepresented communities to teach and learn earth data science. The EDSC builds sustainable teaching capacity while training students in critical data and career development skills in a virtual space. Access to these skills is further democratized by publishing curricular materials online as open education resources for anyone to use.Here we will present best practices for teaching and learning EDS skills online, derived from a program-wide evaluation that considers underrepresented groups, supports mentorship and community building, and scales to broaden reach. We will discuss tools comprising our learning environment including a cloud-based JupyterHub and autograding platform. We will also review best practices for online content delivery including 1. pairing synchronous video training with open education resources to facilitate active, student-directed learning; 2. using discussion forums and chat to encourage engagement, and 3. managing student mentoring challenges in a virtual space to support project-based learning.Initial findings indicate that online learning can effectively build confidence in using EDS skills but requires careful consideration of teaching delivery. Further, the use of small breakout rooms paired with chat supports class level engagement. Finally, open education resources can support a flipped classroom approach. Mentoring students in a virtual space further requires additional training of mentors to ensure communication lines with students remain open. Collecting real-time student feedback and modifying our delivery will also be discussed.},

	abstract = {Data-intensive skills are becoming increasingly critical in earth and environmental science. As data sets become larger, more numerous, and harder to analyze, there is a need for scientists who can develop earth and environmental data science (EDS) workflows that are open, reproducible, and use modern programming languages. To leverage the full potential of EDS, attention should also be focused on broadening participation by members of groups who have been historically underrepresented in data science and STEM. The Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC) program, hosted at Earth Lab (CIRES/CU Boulder) with partners from tribal colleges and minority-serving institutions throughout the Front Range and Northern Great Plains, offers one approach to introducing EDS to underserved communities. EDSC engages participants with fundamental Python programming tools and packages (pandas, numpy, matplotlib), along with resources to work with time- series, and vector and raster spatial data (earthpy, geopandas, rioxarray) in the context of EDS. Beginning in 2020, EDSC has built capacity for our partners to teach EDS at their home institutions and helped students develop confidence and comfort in a variety of different science and data science areas. Through a paid internship experience that includes a series of technical workshops and group projects, EDSC participants are assessed in the following five areas: (i) science identity, (ii) science practices, and (iii) Python, (iv) data science, and (v) science communication skills. Using a retrospective pre-then-post design, Likert-type survey items were analyzed using Rasch modeling to measure growth in EDSC participants’ self-reported comfort and confidence in the five areas outlined above. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of person ability measures from Rasch modeling of survey responses collected during Year 1 of EDSC revealed significant differences from pre- to post- program, and between the five assessment areas. Post-hoc analysis pointed to significant growth in each of the five assessment areas with the exception of Science Identity. Collection and analysis of Year 2 EDSC survey responses is ongoing and results are forthcoming. Implications for teaching earth and environmental data science to members of historically underrepresented communities will be discussed.},

These skills are imperative to harness information contained in a growing volume of complex data to solve the world's most pressing environmental challenges. Despite the importance of these skills, Earth and Environmental Data Science (EDS) training is not equally accessible, contributing to a lack of diversity in the field. This creates a critical need for EDS training opportunities designed specifically for underrepresented groups. In response, we developed the Earth Data Science Corps (EDSC) which couples a paid internship for undergraduate students with faculty training to build capacity to teach and learn EDS using Python at smaller Minority Serving Institutions. EDSC faculty participants are further empowered to teach these skills at their home institutions which scales the program beyond the training lead by our team. Using a Rasch modeling approach, we found that participating in the EDSC program had a significant impact on undergraduate learners’ comfort and confidence with technical and non-technical data science skills, as well as their science identity and sense of belonging in science, two critical aspects of recruiting and retaining members of underrepresented groups in STEM.},

	abstract = {A substantial fraction of students who complete their college education at a public university in the United States begin their journey at one of the 935 public two-year colleges. While the number of four-year colleges offering bachelor's degrees in data science continues to increase, data science instruction at many two-year colleges lags behind. A major impediment is the relative paucity of introductory data science courses that serve multiple student audiences and can easily transfer. In addition, the lack of pre-defined transfer pathways (or articulation agreements) for data science creates a growing disconnect that leaves students who want to study data science at a disadvantage. We describe opportunities and barriers to data science transfer pathways. Five points of curricular friction merit attention: 1) a first course in data science, 2) a second course in data science, 3) a course in scientific computing, data science workflow, and/or reproducible computing, 4) lab sciences, and 5) navigating communication, ethics, and application domain requirements in the context of general education and liberal arts course mappings. We catalog existing transfer pathways, efforts to align curricula across institutions, obstacles to overcome with minimally-disruptive solutions, and approaches to foster these pathways. Improvements in these areas are critically important to ensure that a broad and diverse set of students are able to engage and succeed in undergraduate data science programs.},

However, students at institutions with limited resources have received relatively little exposure to curricula or professional development opportunities that lead to careers in genomic data science. To broaden participation in genomics research, the scientific community needs to support these programs in local education and research at underserved institutions (UIs). These include community colleges, historically Black colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal colleges and universities that support ethnically, racially, and socioeconomically underrepresented students in the United States. We have formed the Genomic Data Science Community Network to support students, faculty, and their networks to identify opportunities and broaden access to genomic data science. These opportunities include expanding access to infrastructure and data, providing UI faculty development opportunities, strengthening collaborations among faculty, recognizing UI teaching and research excellence, fostering student awareness, developing modular and open-source resources, expanding course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs), building curriculum, supporting student professional development and research, and removing financial barriers through funding programs and collaborator support.},

We show that the city of Denver, Colorado, displays similar race- and ethnicity-based air pollution disparities by using a combination of high-resolution satellite data, air pollution modeling, historical demographic information, and areal apportionment techniques. TROPOMI NO2 columns and modeled PM2.5 concentrations from 2019 are higher in communities subject to redlining. We calculated and compared Spearman coefficients for pollutants and race at the census tract level for every city that underwent redlining to contextualize the disparities in Denver. We find that the location of polluting infrastructure leads to higher populations of POC living near point sources, including 40\% higher Hispanic and Latino populations. This influences pollution distribution, with annual average PM2.5 surface concentrations of 6.5 μg m–3 in census tracts with 0–5\% Hispanic and Latino populations and 7.5 μg m–3 in census tracts with 60–65\% Hispanic and Latino populations. Traffic analysis and emission inventory data show that POC are more likely to live near busy highways. Unequal spatial distribution of pollution sources and POC have allowed for pollution disparities to persist despite attempts by the city to rectify them. Finally, we identify the core causes of the pollution disparities to provide direction for remediation.},

Structural equation model analyses supported our predictions. Among the undergraduates, science (but not leadership/teamwork), self-efficacy, and identity as a scientist fully mediated the effects of science support experiences and were strong predictors of commitment. Results for the graduate/postdoctoral sample revealed a very similar pattern of results, with the added finding that all three psychological mediators, including leadership/teamwork self-efficacy, predicted commitment.},

	abstract = {Native Americans are the least represented population in science fields. In recent years, undergraduate and graduate level summer research programs that aimed to increase the number of Native Americans in science have made some progress. As new programs are designed, key characteristics that address science self-efficacy and science identity and provide supports for Native American students’ commitment to a scientific career should be considered. In this study, we used sequential mixed methods to investigate the potential of culturally tailored internship programs on Native American persistence in science. We analyzed surveys (n = 47) and interviews (n = 4) with Native American students to understand their perceptions of themselves in relation to science research and how summer research experiences might develop science identities. Based on regression modeling, science identity, but not science self-efficacy, predicted intent to persist in science. In turn, science self-efficacy and Native American identity predicted science identity, and this suggests cultural identity is central to Native American persistence in science. In interviews, students’ comments reinforced these findings and shed light on students’ reasoning about the kinds of science experiences they sought; specifically, they chose to participate in culturally tailored internships because these programs provided a sense of belonging to the scientific community that did not conflict with their cultural identities. Based on our analysis, we propose an Indigenous science internship model and recommend that agencies target funding for culturally tailored programs from high school through early-investigator levels as well as provide inclusive programmatic and mentoring guidelines.},

This article introduces the perspective lens of students who have gone through the Montgomery College Data Science Certificate Program. We found that, contrary to many other educational fields at the College, data science students tend to come from diverse backgrounds and career paths. A common theme emerged that all students learned valuable skills and applications such as coding in various programming languages and approaches to machine learning. Other meaningful themes included an appreciation of course accessibility, especially catered toward busy professionals who might only be able to take evening courses. Students appreciated learning that data science and ethics are intertwined. Finally, it was evident that going through the data science program positively impacted the lives and careers of these students. The implications of the themes of these student experiences are discussed as they relate to data science education. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Big data generally refer to massive volumes of data not readily handled by the usual data tools and practices and present unprecedented opportunities for advancing science and informing resource management through data-intensive approaches. The era of big data need not be propelled only by “big science” – the term used to describe large-scale efforts that have had mixed success in the individual-driven culture of ecology. Collectively, ecologists already have big data to bolster the scientific effort – a large volume of distributed, high-value information – but many simply fail to contribute. We encourage ecologists to join the larger scientific community in global initiatives to address major scientific and societal problems by bringing their distributed data to the table and harnessing its collective power.

	abstract = {Vegetation phenology controls the seasonality of many ecosystem processes, as well as numerous biosphere-atmosphere feedbacks. Phenology is also highly sensitive to climate change and variability. Here we present a series of datasets, together consisting of almost 750 years of observations, characterizing vegetation phenology in diverse ecosystems across North America. Our data are derived from conventional, visible-wavelength, automated digital camera imagery collected through the PhenoCam network. For each archived image, we extracted RGB (red, green, blue) colour channel information, with means and other statistics calculated across a region-of-interest (ROI) delineating a specific vegetation type. From the high-frequency (typically, 30 min) imagery, we derived time series characterizing vegetation colour, including “canopy greenness”, processed to 1- and 3-day intervals. For ecosystems with one or more annual cycles of vegetation activity, we provide estimates, with uncertainties, for the start of the “greenness rising” and end of the “greenness falling” stages. The database can be used for phenological model validation and development, evaluation of satellite remote sensing data products, benchmarking earth system models, and studies of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems.},
