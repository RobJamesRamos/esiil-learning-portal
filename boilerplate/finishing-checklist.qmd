# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Your task:
1.  If you didn't already, go back to the code you modified about and write more descriptive **comments** so the next person to use this code knows what it does.

:::: {.content-visible when-format="ipynb"}
2.  Make sure to `Restart` and `Run all` up at the top of your notebook. This will clear all your variables and make sure that your code runs in the correct order. It will also export your work in Markdown format, which you can put on your website.

## Always run your code start to finish before submitting!

Before you commit your work, make sure it runs **reproducibly** by clicking: 

  1. `Restart` (this button won't appear until you've run some code), then 
  2. `Run All`
