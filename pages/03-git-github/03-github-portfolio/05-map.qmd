## Finding locations and boundaries

### About Spatial Vector Data

Vector data are composed of discrete geometric locations (x, y values) known as vertices that define the “shape” of the spatial object. The organization of the vertices determines the type of vector that you are working with. There are three types of vector data:

**Points:** Each individual point is defined by a single x, y coordinate. Examples of point data include: sampling locations, the location of individual trees or the location of plots.

**Lines:** Lines are composed of many (at least 2) vertices, or points, that are connected. For instance, a road or a stream may be represented by a line. This line is composed of a series of segments, each “bend” in the road or stream represents a vertex that has defined x, y location.

**Polygons:** A polygon consists of 3 or more vertices that are connected and “closed”. Thus, the outlines of plot boundaries, lakes, oceans, and states or countries are often represented by polygons.

### Mapping libraries

You'll need to start by importing the following libraries
```{python}
# Work with vector data
import geopandas as gpd

# Create interactive maps and plots
import hvplot.pandas

# Search for locations by name - this might take a moment
from osmnx import features as osm
```

### Search for a point of interest

You can use the `pyrosm` package to download and search for spatial vector data in your area.

First, explore the available datasets. You'll want to download the smallest available area, such as a city or state. In this case, we're looking for the location of the United Tribes Technical College campus in North Dakota.

```{python}
# Search for United Tribes Technical College
uttc_gdf = osm.features_from_address(
    'United Tribes Technical College, Bismarck, ND, United States',
    {'building': True})
uttc_gdf.plot()
```

We have a map of the UTTC Campus!
### Create a map

```{python}
# Plot UTTC boundary
uttc_map = uttc_gdf.hvplot(
    title="United Tribes Technical College",
    fill_color='orange', line_color='black',
    geo=True, tiles='EsriImagery',
    frame_width=600)
uttc_map
```

```{python}
# import holoviews as hv
# hv.save(uttc_map, 'uttc_map.png')
```
