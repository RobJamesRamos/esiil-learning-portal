## Images make your website easier to understand

The following code will display an image using Markdown:

```markdown
![Mississippi Delta from space](https://deltax.jpl.nasa.gov/img/delta-google-earth.jpg)
```

![Mississippi Delta from space](https://deltax.jpl.nasa.gov/img/delta-google-earth.jpg)

> Image source: image of the Mississippi Delta from the [Jet Propulsion Laboratory DeltaX project](https://deltax.jpl.nasa.gov/about/)

Always make sure to give credit to your image sources. Make sure you have permission to use images, too. Most images are fair to use for education (teaching, research, and study), as long as you cite and link back to the original. If you later on decide to use your portfolio to make money (i.e. if you use it as marketing materials for your job), then you should reconsider what images you are using. *Learn more about fair use from the [CU Library Fair Use page](https://www.colorado.edu/libraries/copyright-information/fair-use).*

## Adding your own images

There are three ways we will focus on that you can go about adding your own images to your website:

  1. Uploading an image to your portfolio repository on GitHub
  2. Uploading an image elsewhere and then linking to it on the web
  3. Generate an image with code

We'll look at the first two in this lesson. But first, you need to understand the difference between **absolute** and **relative** links on the web.

### Absolute and relative links

### Upload an image to GitHub

### Other places to host images
