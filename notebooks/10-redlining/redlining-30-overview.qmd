# Redlining -- Racism you can see from space

Redlining is a form of systemic racism that funnels resources away from (typically) Black neighborhoods in the United States. Several mechanisms contribute to the overall disinvestment, including requirements that particular homeowners sell only to other white people, and labeling Black neighborhoods as poor investments and thereby preventing anyone in those neighborhoods from getting mortgages and other loans.

You can read more about redlining and data science in [Chapter 2 of Data Feminism (@dignazio_2_2020)].

In this case study, you will download satellite-based **multispectral** data for the City of Denver, and compare that to redlining maps and results from the U.S. Census American Community Survey.
