## It's another ESIIL Earth Data Science Workflow

This notebook contains your next environmental data science (EDS) coding challenge! 
Before we get started, make sure to read or review the guidelines below. These will help make sure that your code is *readable* and *reproducible*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Don't get **caught** by these interactive coding notebook gotchas

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:4800/format:webp/1*o0HleR7BSe8W-pTnmucqHA.jpeg" height="300" style="padding: 1em; border-style: solid; border-color: grey;"/>

> *Image source: https://alaskausfws.medium.com/whats-big-and-brown-and-loves-salmon-e1803579ee36*

These are the most common issues that will keep you from getting started and delay your code review:

### Run your code in the right **environment** to avoid import errors

We've created a coding **environment** for you to use that already has all the software and libraries you will need! When you try to run some code, you may be prompted to select a **kernel**. \* The **kernel** refers to the version of Python you are using \* You should use the **base** kernel, which should be the default option.

### Always run your code start to finish before submitting

Before you commit your work, make sure it runs **reproducibly** by clicking: 1. `Restart` (this button won't appear until you've run some code), then 2. `Run All`

### **Check your code to make sure it's clean and easy to read**

<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSO1w9WrbwbuMLN14IezH-iq2HEGwO3JDvmo5Y_hQIy7k-Xo2gZH-mP2GUIG6RFWL04X1k&amp;usqp=CAU" height="200"/>

-   Format all cells prior to submitting (right click on your code).

-   Use expressive names for variables so you or the reader knows what they are.

-   Use comments to explain your code -- e.g.

    ``` python
    # This is a comment, it starts with a hash sign
    ```

### **Label and describe your plots**

![Source: https://xkcd.com/833](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/convincing.png)

Make sure each plot has: \* A title that explains where and when the data are from \* x- and y- axis labels with **units** where appropriate \* A legend where appropriate

# **Get started with open reproducible science!**

[Open reproducible science](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/get-started-open-reproducible-science/) makes scientific methods, data and outcomes available to everyone. That means that *everyone* who wants should be able to **find**, **read**, **understand**, and **run** your workflows for themselves.

<img src="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/s3fs-public/2021-11/Circle_Diagram_UPDATE_2.jpg?VersionId=pFRniRpjtgc_MEXUJKi9_sXLoMsSX.pB" alt-text="Components of open science - accessible, reproducible, inclusive" width="500"/>

Few if any science projects are 100% open and reproducible (yet!). However, members of the open science community have developed open source tools and practices that can help you move toward that goal. You will learn about many of those tools in [the Intro to Earth Data Science textbook](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/). Don't worry about learning all the tools at once -- we've picked a few for you to get started with.

## **Readable, well-documented scientific workflows are easier to reproduce**

As the comic below suggests, code that is hard to read is also hard to get working. We refer to code that is easy to read as **clean** code.

[![And because if you just leave it there, it's going to start contaminating things downstream even if no one touches it directly. (from [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/2138/))](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wanna_see_the_code.png)](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2138:_Wanna_See_the_Code%3F)

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## {{< fa pencil size=large >}} In the prompt below, list 3 things you can do to write clean code, and then list 3 more advantages of doing so.

-   Edit the text below. You may have to double click.
-   You can use examples from the textbook, or come up with your own.
-   Use [**Markdown**](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to format your list.
:::

I can write clean code by: `YOUR ANSWER HERE`

Advantages of clean code include: `YOUR ANSWER HERE`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **What the fork?! Who wrote this?**

Below is a scientific Python workflow. But something's wrong -- The code won't run! Your task is to follow the instructions below to **clean and debug** the Python code below so that it runs.

::: callout-tip
Don't worry if you can't solve every bug right away. We'll get there! The most important thing is to identify problems with the code and write high-quality [**GitHub Issues**](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository)
:::

At the end, you'll **repeat the workflow** for a location and measurement of your choosing.

### Alright! Let's clean up this code. First things first...

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Machine-readable file names

Rename this notebook if necessary with an [**expressive and machine-readable file name**](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/get-started-open-reproducible-science/best-practices-for-organizing-open-reproducible-science/)
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Python **packages** let you use code written by experts around the world

Because Python is open source, lots of different people and organizations can contribute (including you!). Many contributions are in the form of **packages** which do not come with a standard Python download.

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
# {{< fa glasses size=large >}} Read more

[Packages need to be installed and **imported**](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/python-code-fundamentals/use-python-packages/).
:::

In the cell below, someone was trying to import the **pandas package**, which helps us to work with [**tabular data** such as comma-separated value or csv files](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/file-formats/use-text-files/).

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Your task

1. Correct the typo below to properly import the pandas package under its **alias** pd.
2. Run the cell to import pandas
:::

```{python}
#| error: true
# Import pandas
import pandsa as pd
```

::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: See our solution!
# Import pandas
import pandas as pd
```
:::

Once you have run the cell above and imported `pandas`, **run the cell below**. It is a test cell that will tell you if you completed the task successfully. If a test cell isn't working the way you expect, check that you ran your code **immediately before** running the test.

```{python}
# DO NOT MODIFY THIS TEST CELL
points = 0
try:
    pd.DataFrame()
    points += 5
    print('\u2705 Great work! You correctly imported the pandas library.')
except:
    print('\u274C Oops - pandas was not imported correctly.')
print('You earned {} of 5 points for importing pandas'.format(points))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **There are more Earth Observation data online than any one person could ever look at**

[NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) alone manages over 9PB of data](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/getting-petabytes-people-how-eosdis-facilitates-earth-observing-data-discovery-and-use). 1 PB is roughly 100 times the entire Library of Congress (a good approximation of all the books available in the US). It's all available to **you** once you learn how to download what you want.

Here we're using the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) [Access Data Service](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation) application progamming interface (API) to request data from their web servers. We will be using data collected as part of the Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) from their [Climate Data Online library](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets) program at NOAA.

For this example we're requesting [daily summary data in Boulder, CO (station ID USC00050848)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/GHCND/stations/GHCND:USC00050848/detail) located on the NOAA Campus (**39.99282°, -105.26683°**).

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
## {{< fa pencil size=large >}} Your task:

1.  Research the [**Global Historical Climatology Network - Daily**](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html) data source.
2.  In the cell below, write a 2-3 sentence description of the data source. You should describe:
    -   who takes the data
    -   where the data were taken
    -   what the maximum temperature units are
    -   how the data are collected
3.  Include a citation of the data (**HINT:** See the 'Data Citation' tab on the GHCNd overview page).
:::

**YOUR DATA DESCRIPTION AND CITATION HERE** 🛎️

## **You can access NCEI GHCNd Data from the internet using its API** 🖥️ 📡 🖥️

The cell below contains the URL for the data you will use in this part of the notebook. We created this URL by generating what is called an **API endpoint** using the NCEI [API documentation](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/support/access-data-service-api-user-documentation).

::: callout-note
An **application programming interface** (API) is a way for two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)).
:::

However, we still have a problem - we can't get the URL back later on because it isn't saved in a **variable**. In other words, we need to give the url a name so that we can request in from Python later (sadly, Python has no 'hey what was that thingy I typed yesterday?' function).

::: {.callout-note icon="false"}
## {{< fa glasses size=large >}} Read more

Check out the [textbook section on variables](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/python-code-fundamentals/get-started-using-python/variables/)
:::

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Your task

1.  Pick an expressive variable name for the URL

    > HINT: click on the `Variables` button up top to see all your variables. Your new url variable will not be there until you define it and run the code

2.  Reformat the URL so that it adheres to the [79-character PEP-8 line limit](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length)

    > HINT: You should see two vertical lines in each cell - don't let your code go past the second line

3.  At the end of the cell where you define your url variable, **call your variable (type out its name)** so it can be tested.
:::

```{python}

    print('\u274C Oops - your url variable is not the correct length.')

print('You earned {} of 6 points for defining a url variable'.format(points))
```

## **Download and get started working with NCEI data**

The `pandas` library you imported can download data from the internet directly into a type of Python **object** called a `DataFrame`. In the code cell below, you can see an attempt to do just this. But there are some problems...

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} You're ready to fix some code!

Your task is to:

1.  Leave a space between the `#` and text in the comment and try making the comment more informative

2.  Make any changes needed to get this code to run. HINT: The `my_url` variable doesn't exist - you need to replace it with the variable name **you** chose.

3.  Modify the `.read_csv()` statement to include the following parameters:

    -   `index_col='DATE'` -- this sets the `DATE` column as the index. Needed for subsetting and resampling later on
    -   `parse_dates=True` -- this lets `python` know that you are working with time-series data, and values in the indexed column are **date time objects**
    -   `na_values=['NaN']` -- this lets `python` know how to handle missing values

4.  Clean up the code by using **expressive variable names**, **expressive column names**, **PEP-8 compliant code**, and **descriptive comments**
:::

::: {callout-warning}
**Make sure to call your `DataFrame` by typing it's name as the last line of your code cell** Then, you will be able to run the test cell below and find out if your answer is correct.

## Plot the precpitation column (PRCP) vs time to explore the data

Plotting in Python is easy, but not quite this easy:

```{python}
#| error: true
boulder_df.plot()
```

You'll always need to add some instructions on labels and how you want your plot to look.

::: {.callout-important}

1.  Change `dataframe` to **your** `DataFrame` name.
2.  Change `y=` to the name of your **observed temperature** column name.
3.  Use the `title`, `ylabel`, and `xlabel` parameters to add key text to your plot.
4.  Adjust the size of your figure using `figsize=(x,y)` where `x` is figure width and `y` is figure height

> **HINT:** labels have to be a *type* in Python called a **string**. You can make a string by putting quotes around your label, just like the column names in the sample code (eg `y='TOBS'`).
:::

```{python}
#| error: true
# Plot the temperature vs time
your_dataframe_name.plot(y='temperature_col_name', figsize=(10,6))
```

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Your task: Playing with code

# {{< fa pepper-hot size=large >}} Want an EXTRA CHALLENGE?

There are many other things you can do to customize your plot. Take a look at the [pandas plotting galleries](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html) and the [documentation of plot](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) to see if there's other changes you want to make to your plot. Some possibilities include: 

  * Remove the legend since there's only one data series 
  * Increase the figure size 
  * Increase the font size 
  * Change the colors 
  * Use a bar graph instead (usually we use lines for time series, but since this is annual it could go either way) 
  * Add a trend line

Not sure how to do any of these? Try searching the internet, or asking an AI!

1. As you did above, rewrite the code to be more expressive 
2. Using the code below as a framework, write and apply a **function** that converts to Celcius. \> **Functions** let you reuse code you have already written
3.  You should also rewrite this function and parameter names to be more expressive.

## Now we are ready to calculate annual statistics

Here you will **resample** the 2013-2023 data to look the annual mean values.

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Resample your data

1. Replace `new_variable_name` with the variable you created in the cell above where you subset the data 
2. Replace `'TIME'` with a `'W'`, `'M'`, or `'Y'` depending on whether you're doing a weekly, monthly, or yearly summary 
3. Replace `STAT` with a `sum`, `min`, `max`, or `mean` depending on what kind of statistic you're interested in calculating. 
4. Replace `resampled_data` with a more expressive variable name 
5. Call your new variable 
6. Run the cell
:::

```{python}
# Resample the data to look at yearly mean values
boulder_yearly_mean = boulder_1983_2023.resample('Y').mean()
boulder_yearly_mean
```

::: {.callout-important icon="false"}
# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Plot your resampled data
:::

```{python}
# Plot mean annual temperature values
```

# {{< fa pencil size=large >}} Describe your plot

We like to use an approach called "Assertion-Evidence" for presenting scientific results. There's a lot of video tutorials and example talks available on [the Assertion-Evidence web page](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/). The main thing you need to do now is to practice writing a **message** or **headline** rather than descriptions or topic sentences for the plot you just made (what they refer to as "visual evidence").

For example, it would be tempting to write something like "A plot of maximum annual temperature in Boulder, Colorado over time (1983-2023)". However, this doesn't give the reader anything to look at, or explain why we made this particular plot (we know, you made **this** one because we told you to)

Some alternatives that are more of a starting point for a presentation or conversation are: \* Boulder, CO experienced cooler than average temperatures in 1995 \* Temperatures in Bouler, CO appear to be on the rise over the past 40 years \* Maximum annual temperatures in Boulder, CO are becoming more variable over the previous 40 years

We could back up some of these claims with further analysis included later on, but we want to make sure that our audience has some guidance on what to look for in the plot.

## **Your turn: pick a new location and/or measurement to plot** 🌏 📈

Below (or in a new notebook!), recreate the workflow you just did in a place that interests you OR with a different measurement. See the instructions above to adapt the URL that we created for Boulder, CO using the NCEI API. You will need to make your own new Markdown and Code cells below this one, or create a new notebook.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Congratulations, you're almost done with this coding challenge** 🤩 -- now make sure that your code is *reproducible*

# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Your task
1.  If you didn't already, go back to the code you modified about and write more descriptive **comments** so the next person to use this code knows what it does.

2.  Make sure to `Restart` and `Run all` up at the top of your notebook. This will clear all your variables and make sure that your code runs in the correct order. It will also export your work in Markdown format, which you can put on your website.
