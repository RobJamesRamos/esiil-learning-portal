# Part 3: Convert units

It's important to keep track of the units of all your data. You don't want to be like the [NASA team who crashed a probe into Mars because different teams used different units](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-oct-01-mn-17288-story.html))!

## Use labels to keep track of units for you and your collaborators

One way to keep track of your data's units is to include the unit in data **labels**. In the case of a `DataFrame`, that usually means the column names.

::: {.content-visible when-format="ipynb"}
Before we get started, make sure to load the climate `DataFrame` you stored in the previous notebooks using Jupyter cell magic:

```{python}
# Load all stored variables
%store -r
```

A big part of writing **expressive** code is descriptive labels. Let's rename the columns of your dataframe to include units. Complete the following steps:

  1. Replace `dataframe` with the name of **your** `DataFrame`, and `dataframe_units` with an expressive new name.
  2. Check out the [documentation for GCHNd data](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-historical-climatology-network-daily/doc/GHCND_documentation.pdf). We downloaded data with "standard" units; find out what that means for both temperature and precipitation.
  3. Replace `'TOBS_UNIT'` and `'PRCP_UNIT'` with column names that reference the correct unit for each.

:::
```{python}
#| error: true
dataframe_units = dataframe.rename(columns={
    'TOBS': 'TOBS_UNIT',
    'PRCP': 'PRCP_UNIT'
})

dataframe
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: See our solution!
climate_u_df = climate_df.rename(columns={
    'TOBS': 'temp_f',
    'PRCP': 'precip_in'
})
climate_u_df
```

## For scientific applications, it is often useful to have values in metric units

# {{< fa keyboard size=large >}} Your task: Convert units

The code below attempts to convert the data to Celcius, using Python mathematical **operators**, like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Mathematical operators in Python work just like a calculator, and that includes using parentheses to designat the **order of operations**. The equation for converting Fahrenheit temperature to Celcius is:

$$
T_C = (T_F - 32) * \frac{5}{9}
$$

This code is not well documented and doesn't follow [PEP-8 guidelines](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations), which has caused the author to miss an **important error**!

Complete the following steps:

  1. Replace `dataframe` with the name of **your** `DataFrame`.
  2. Replace `'old_temperature'` with the column name **you** used; Replace `'new_temperature'` with an **expressive** column name. 
  3. **THERE IS AN ERROR IN THE CONVERSION MATH - Fix it!**
:::

```{python}
#| error: true
dataframe_units['new_temperature']= dataframe_units['old_temperature']-32*5/9
dataframe_units
```

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: See our solution!
climate_u_df['temp_c'] = (climate_u_df['temp_f'] - 32) * 5 / 9

climate_u_df
```

Using the code below as a framework, write and apply a **function** that converts to Celcius. You should also rewrite this function name to be more expressive.
  
```python
def convert(temperature):
    """Convert temperature to Celcius"""
    return temperature # Put your equation in here

dataframe['TOBS_C'] = dataframe['TOBS'].apply(convert)
```
