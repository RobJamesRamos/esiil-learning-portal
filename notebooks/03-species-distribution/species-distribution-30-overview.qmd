Tasiyagnunpa (or Western Meadowlark, or *sturnella neglecta*) migrates each year to nest on the Great Plains in the United States. Using crowd-sourced observations of these birds, we can see that migration happening throughout the year.

The Veery thrush (Catharus fuscescens) migrates each year between nesting sites in the U.S. and Canada, and South America. Veeries are small birds, and encountering a hurricane during their migration would be disasterous. However, Ornithologist Christopher Hechscher has found in tracking their migration that their breeding patterns and migration timing can predicting the severity of hurricane season as accurately as meterological models [@heckscher_nearctic-neotropical_2018]!
