## We're all feeling the heat!

[The summer of 2024 was the hottest yet](https://www.nasa.gov/earth/nasa-finds-summer-2024-hottest-to-date/), [@younger_nasa_2024] and every indication is that the heat is only going to get more intense. Communities need to protect their vulnerable members by adapting to the changing climate with solutions informed by their cultural, geographic, and political context.

### Place-based, culturally-relevant curriculum is essential to engaging diverse groups of students

Because this is a **place-based** learning exercise, it can be adapted to different cultural contexts. This is a key element we hear about when asking communities how to teach Earth Data Science in a culturally responsive way.

Heat affects different communities in different ways. Here are some questions to help spark a conversation with classmates or with members of your community:

  * What effects has **heat** had on your **community**?
  * What **changes** have you observed to the climate over your lifetime? Can you talk to an elder and find out what changes they have observed? 
  * How have **policies** like redlining influenced **community vulnerability** to heat waves?
  * Are there **traditional building methods or ecological practices** in your culture that help to mitigate the effects of heat waves?
:::

We know it can be tough to talk about climate change -- be easy on yourselves! One way to help have a positive conversation about climate change is to talk about solutions. After all, when it comes to a life-or-death issue like heat waves, we can't let the conversation end with observing the situation. 

::: {.callout-discuss}
What are some short- and long-term strategies for **mitigating** the effects of heat on your community? If you were implementing mitigation strategies, **who would you reach out to first**? Below are some examples of some types of strategies you could discuss:

  * **Reaching out to vulnerable community members** through cultural and religious institutions to provide aid such as transportation to an air conditioned space, ensure water supply, and cool down buildings with strategies like fans and radiation-blocking window films.
  * Culturally and climatically appropriate **changes to the built environment** to reduce heat absorption and storage during heat waves.
  * Culturally and climatically appropriate changes and/or **expansion of green space** to reduce heat absorption and storage
  * **Cultural events** to help your community adapt

Making cultural connections is important for achieving learning goals and engaging diverse groups of students.

### Meet your classroom learning goals with Earth Data Science

We have also developed this activity so that it can be adapted to many different academic disciplines, and we encourage you to do so in your classes! For example:

| Discipline | Learning Goals |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Physics | Explain how aspects of heat transfer such as**albedo**, **thermal mass**, and **latent heat** relate to the Urban Heat Island effect|
| Biology | Biological concepts that cause the Urban Heat Island effect such as **transpiration**, **photosynthesis**, and **homeostasis** |
| Statistics | Probability distributions for average and extreme temperatures, stationarity, and hypothesis testing to determine differences among sites |
| Calculus | Processes governing heat transfer |

:::{.callout-read .column-margin title="Air Temperature vs. Surface Temperature"}
We'll be looking at air temperature in this analysis rather than surface temperature. Some of you may have clocked that the surface temperature is more related to the Urban Heat Island mechanism! However, the two are closely related, so we think we can still examing Urban Heat Island effects using air temperature. Check out this resource from the EPA [@us_epa_learn_2014] on the relationship between air temperature and surface temperature and the Urban Heat Island effect:

## **Case Study:** Chicago summer 2024 heat wave

![Source: Illinois State Climatologist; Daily June average temperatures and departures from normal in Chicago](https://stateclimatologist.web.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Chicago_temps-768x338.png)

According to the [Illinois state climatology office](https://stateclimatologist.web.illinois.edu/2024/07/) [@illinois_state_water_survey_warm_2024], daily average temperatures between June 13 and June 25 were 5 to 15 degrees above normal in Chicago and statewide. Overnight temperatures in Chicago were forecast to [stay into the 70's](https://chicago.suntimes.com/weather/2024/06/17/chicago-weather-heat-dome-wave-hot-temperatures-what-you-should-know) with record breaking temperatures being attributed to [climate change](https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-heat-wave-how-to-stay-cool-safe/).

If you teach in or near Chicago, your students probably have some feelings about how hot it was! The Chicago area is known for its at times extreme weather, but cities get hit particularly hard by heat waves due to the urban heat island effect. [This article from WGN](https://wgntv.com/weather/weather-blog/chicago-is-an-urban-heat-island-so-what-does-that-mean/) [@alix_martichoux_urban_2024] explains what this means for cities like Chicago.

### Heat kills

Climate change is intensifying summer heat in Chicago, particularly in heat island areas, which disproportionately affects marginalized communities. These neighborhoods, often with less green space and more heat-trapping infrastructure, face higher temperatures and greater health risks [@us_epa_heat_2019].

Chicago O'Hare International Airport is a known heat island often reporting temperatures 5-10 degrees warmer than surrounding communities [@nbc_chicago_what_2022].

### Is it cooler by the lake?

Many Chicagoans know that one of the best ways to beat the heat is to head to the lake. In this we'll try to answer whether it's *really* [**cooler by the Lake**](), and what Chicago could do to cool down the rest of the City.

![WGN Temperature Forecast -- it's cooler by the lake!](https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/04/NLanimation10and11.gif)

We will select two climate stations located within the greater Chicago area: O'Hare International Airport (Station ID: USW00094846), and Northerly Island (Station ID: USC00111550) to explore trends in maximum daily temperatures.

## Get started with open, reproducible science in the cloud

We will be using [Python]() and [GitHub codespaces](), two popular open-source data science tools, to do the coding for this workshop, along with [GitHub classroom]() to distribute the activity. You will not need to download or install anything on your computer - everything we'll do can be done in the cloud! You and your students will need a free GitHub account in order to accept the assignment from GitHub classroom and complete the activity.

::: {.callout-tip .column-margin}
For those interested, we have created a working Python environment that we host on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/earthlab/earth-analytics-python-env). Feel free to share this with your students or research group.

We're excited to get started doing some EDS with you!
