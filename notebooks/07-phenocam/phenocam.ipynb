        "\n",
        "Established in 2008, the [PhenoCam Network](https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/) is a collection of \\>700 digital cameras that take regular (\\~ every 30 min) pictures of ecosystem canopies around the world. The name PhenoCam comes from the combination of the words \"phenology\" and \"camera\", because the images are an easy and effective way to study the phenology, or the timing of seasonal changes, of vegetation across diverse ecosystems. The images are available in near-real time to view on the [PhenoCam website](https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/), and can also be downloaded through the [`phenocamapi` R package](https://github.com/PhenoCamNetwork/phenocamapi), which we'll cover in this tutorial. There are currently over 60 million images available!\n",

        "#### Quantifying Greenness\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond being pretty pictures, PhenoCam images also provide a quantitative way to track vegetation phenology by measuring the intensity of canopy greenness. Digital images are stored as three different color channels - red, green, and blue (RGB) - which are the primary colors of light, and combine in different ratios to create all the visible colors in a photograph. Old-style TVs use this same method, as does your smartphone.\n",

        "\n",
        "Each digital pixel has a numerical value for each color channel (RGB) that represents its intensity. We can use these values to quantify the relative intensity of green compared to the overall brightness of the image. We call this the Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) and calculate it using the equation below.\n",

        "![Equation to calculate the relative greenness (GCC) of a digital image.](/img/notebooks/phenocam/GCC_equation.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"250\"}\n",
        "\n",
        "However, since PhenoCam images usually capture other things besides just the vegetation canopy (e.g., sky, ground, roads, buildings), each site has established portions of the image, or regions of interest (ROIs), that are analyzed for greenness. For example, at this forested site in Canada (lacclair), only the trees in the foreground are included in the GCC calculation:\n",

        "When GCC is calculated over a long time period at a site, a timeseries of vegetation greenness can be created. Below is the GCC timeseries for the \"laccair\" forest site shown above over the past 9 years. Notice the clear seasonal cycle of vegetation green-up in the spring followed by leaf color change and senescence (brown-down/death) in autumn.\n",

        "#### Seasonal Transition Dates\n",
        "\n",
        "These GCC timeseries can be used to extract seasonal transition dates across the years. For example, to determine the timing of spring green-up, we can use the amplitude (height) of each annual peak to determine when (what day of the year) vegetation at the site has reached either 10%, 25%, or 50% of its maximum greenness. We consider this to be the start of spring green-up. We use a similar method to extract the start of autumn brown-down.\n",

        "\n",
        "Over a long time period, the timing of seasonal transition dates can be used to track shifts in vegetation phenology, such as with climate change. This dataset can also be used to determine which environmental and biologic factors (e.g., temperature, rainfall, sunlight) influence the timing of spring leaf-out and autumn color changes.\n",

For example, you need a certain set of tools to build a birdhouse, but a different set of tools to bake a cake. In this case, the \"phenocamapi\" and \"phenocamr\" packages have the tools to interact with and download phenocam data. The other packages listed below assist with visualization and formatting.\n"
